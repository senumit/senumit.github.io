# Research

My research focuses on **soft robotics**, particularly **snake-inspired soft robot design and locomotion**. I aim to understand how snakes exploit frictional anisotropy to achieve locomotion, and how this principle can be replicated through soft robotic systems using engineered materials and compliant structures. Previously, I contributed journal papers on **haptic interfaces & wearable haptic device design**, **multi-robot coordination**, and **visible light positioning**.
