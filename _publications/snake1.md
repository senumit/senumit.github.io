title: "A Highly Articulated Backbone for Soft Snake Robots"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/snake1
excerpt: "Backbones are a critical component of bioinspired snake robots,
providing support and actuator attachment points. Current soft snake
robots overwhelmingly rely on continuum backbones, which are contin-
uous strips or rods. Continuum backbones are straightforward to man-
ufacture, but tie together torsional and bending stiffness, buckling load
and maximum curvature. For example, increasing cross-section size to
raise buckling load increases torsional stiffness and bending stiffness in
at least one plane. Biological snakes have highly articulated backbones
that break these scalings, but they also have complex vertebra geome-
try and musculature. In this work, we develop a concept for a highly
articulated, snake-inspired backbone and a corresponding actuator lay-
out. The artificial vertebrae include key features identified in biology
literature, such as articulation points and motion limiters. We measure
range of motion in two planes, note emergent twist, and demonstrate lo-
comotion. The results show feasibility of an alternative soft snake robot
design, with closer mimicry of biology and significantly higher mechani-
cal complexity. Emergent behaviors tying twist and bending deformation
suggest a path forward for producing complex movements from simple
actuation inputs, but further work is needed to model robot mechanics."
