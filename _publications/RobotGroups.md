title: "Circular formations of non-communicating robot groups via local strategies"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/RobotGroups
excerpt: '<strong>Abstract:</strong> Local strategies, which are based on cost minimization, to achieve circular formations of autonomous robot groups are presented. It is assumed that the group members have no communication capabilities or any means of interchanging information among themselves, and that they can only rely on their sensors, which provide relative positions of their nearby group members. It is verified on simulations that via appropriately defined cost functions arc, arc-triangle and circle formations are obtained, which can be maintained during navigation.'
